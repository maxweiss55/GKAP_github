##Response_Legal - Close-ended response to question: "Would you be willing or unwilling to contribute a DNA sample, for example by a swab from your mouth, for use in current or future investigations to determine a personâ€™s guilt or innocence of a particular crime?"
##OpenEnd_Legal - Follow-up open-ended response to Response_Legal question with "Why [would/wouldn't] you be willing to?"
##Coded_Legal - The classification coded for the OpenEnd_Legal response
##Response_Medical - Close-ended response to question: "Would you be willing or unwilling to contribute a DNA sample, for example by a swab from your mouth, for use in current or future scientific or medical research?"
##OpenEnd_Medical - Follow-up open-ended response to Response_Medical question with "Why [would/wouldn't] you be willing to?"
##Coded_Medical_A - The first classification coded for the OpenEnd_Medical response
##Coded_Medical_B - The second classification coded for the OpenEnd_Medical response

#Note: There is no difference in importance between Coded_Medical_A and Coded_Medical_B, and many responses were not given a second (Coded_Medical_B) classification. Additionally, there is no Coded_Legal_A/Coded_Legal_B because only one classification was given for each legal response

#This dataframe is nearly identical to clean11. Coded_Medical_A and Coded_Medical_B are deleted.

question: \"Why [would/wouldn't] you be willing to?\" These responses were classified by hand to differentiate types of responses. 
The classifications 'XX' (Unintelligible) and 'NA' (No Answer) were not included in this analysis because they are largely
uninformative. The proportion of a classification out of total informative classifications is given by the Relative Frequency above. 
The frequency of classifications coded are largely consistent across years. 'Indeterminate Unwilling' and 'Indeterminate Willing'
were not used in 2011 coding. There does seem to be a deviation in the Value/Medical Cure/Scientific Knowledge classes
This is likely due to differences in researcher coding, as 'Medical Cure' and 'Scienfic Knowledge' are subsets of 'Value'.")

##Close-Ended Analysis


Note: The close-ended responses are ordinal variables ranging in willingness to contribute to a biobank. Now, the response numeric value will align to the following ordinal schema: Unwilling = 0, Somewhat Unwilling = 1, Somewhat Willing = 2, Willing = 3. Increasing numeric value indicates increased willingness to contribute to a biobank.




The following figures show differences in willingness across different demographics.
